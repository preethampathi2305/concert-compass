# Concert-Compass

## The Problem
Most people only know a fraction of the artists 
performing at Festivals

● This is often the reason why many don't purchase a ticket<br/>
● This is often the reason why many people end up re-selling their tickets

## The Solution
Concert Compass only recommends artist that will be at festivals you’ll be attendingNo need to cross-reference between recommendations from Spotify, Apple Music, Youtube, etc., and festival lineups

● Log  in  to  your  music  streaming  service  of  choice  (Spotify,  Apple, Youtube,  etc...)<br/>● You choose what feeds the recommendations<br/>○ Playlist you’ve created○ Specific albums<br/>○ Specific Songs
<br/>● We use machine learning to generate recommendations

## What this means...
● More ticket purchases:<br/>
○ The more artist that you want to see, the more inclined to purchase a ticket<br/>
○ Increase in attendance <br/>
○ Increase in revenue <br/>
● Better user experience:<br/>
○ Users will discover new music<br/>
■ That’s great for both users and artists alike<br/>
■ No more wondering about in hopes that you run into something you like <br/>
○ Less remorse<br/>
■ Less people will re-sale their tickets because they know what they’d be 
missing out on. FOMO


## Competition & Market
● Startups like Festicket and Jukely offer similar features, but no  other  company  is  currently  offering  what  we  are<br/>
● Music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music can be our indirect competitors in the future.○ These streaming services have a great recommendation algorithm

## Festivals are big commitments 
● Coachella: <br/>
● General admission weekend passes start at $499 + service fees<br/>
● VIP weekend passes start at $1,0669 + service fees <br/>
● Safari Camping with guest passes is $9,000<br/>


## Current Status : Prototype MVP
● End-to-end working Flask web application <br/>
● Uses machine learning and Spotify's API to generate artist recommendations<br/>
● hosted the application on AWS EC2.<br/>
